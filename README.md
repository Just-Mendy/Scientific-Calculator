# Scientific Calculator

A simple Java-based scientific calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced scientific functions like power, square root, and trigonometric calculations. This calculator runs in the console and provides a menu-based interface for user interaction.

## Features

The calculator supports the following operations:

1. **Basic Operations**
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division

2. **Scientific Operations**
   - Exponentiation (Power)
   - Square Root
   - Sine, Cosine, and Tangent (in degrees)

3. **Error Handling**
   - Division by zero error
   - Square root of negative numbers

4. **User-Friendly Menu**
   - A simple text-based menu that guides the user through choosing an operation and entering input values.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 11 or later
